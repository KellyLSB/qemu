Subject: [PATCH] ide: Correct improper smart self test counter reset in ide
 core (CVE-2014-2894)

The SMART self test counter was incorrectly being reset to zero,
not 1. This had the effect that on every 21st SMART EXECUTE OFFLINE:
 * We would write off the beginning of a dynamically allocated buffer
 * We forgot the SMART history
Fix this.
