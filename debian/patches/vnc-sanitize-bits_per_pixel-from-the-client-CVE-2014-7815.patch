Subject: vnc: sanitize bits_per_pixel from the client

bits_per_pixel that are less than 8 could result in accessing
non-initialized buffers later in the code due to the expectation
that bytes_per_pixel value that is used to initialize these buffers is
never zero.

To fix this check that bits_per_pixel from the client is one of the
values that the rfb protocol specification allows.

This is CVE-2014-7815.
